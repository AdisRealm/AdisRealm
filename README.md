# Adi's Realm plugin
This is a Bukkit plugin designed specifically for 
the private Minecraft SMP I run. The features are 
tailored for the needs of the SMP and it's members.

## Building from source
This plugin uses maven to automate the building process.
To build the plugin, execute the following command from 
the base folder of the project:
```
mvn clean install
```
The shaded plugin will output to `target/AdisRealm.jar` 
and will be ready to use.
